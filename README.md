I slightly changed my primary question and found relevant datset according to my plan. And I took only one country specifically India anf focused on same urban mobility and road infrastructure in all different aspects. 
And Im trying to make some advanced visualizations like choropeth, Corelation and matrix and geo maps. But im not sure how to make exact one. Ill get clarity about this on next class.
