# Final-Project
### Milestone 1 (Data Acquisition and Pre-processing)

For Milestone 1, I have successfully acquired dataset related to `road_data` dataset containing information about road infrastructure across various states and union territories in India. The primary question being addressed seems to be the relationship between road infrastructure (road length) and other factors such as total area, population density, GDP per capita, etc. These visualizations aim to help policymakers, urban planners, researchers, and other stakeholders understand and analyze the road infrastructure landscape in India.

By visualizing road infrastructure data and its relationship with other variables, stakeholders can make informed decisions to improve transportation systems, enhance connectivity, and foster economic development.

Subsequently, I conducted initial data cleaning, normalization, and pre-processing steps to enhance data quality, consistency, and readiness for further analysis and visualization. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data into a structured format suitable for analysis. These pre-processing steps are crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the analysis, setting a strong foundation for the subsequent stages of the project.
